    "**\"Will my product succeed?\" - Let AI decide**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it does\n",
    "Users can train an AI model to predict if their product will be successful. They upload data about past products (price, marketing budget, how widely it's sold, etc.) and get a score from 0‚Äì100 on whether a new product will succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Frontend Architecture:** Event-driven JavaScript with debounced input validation and progressive form enhancement  \n",

    "## üì¶ FEATURE 2: Smart Inventory Manager\n",
    "**\"Where's my stuff?\" - Organize everything**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it does\n",
    "Think of it like organized folders for your inventory. You can create \"Groups\" (like categories) and add \"Items\" to each group. Each item has a quantity and description. You can search, sort, and manage everything easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",

    "### What it does\n",
    "Users set up alerts like \"text me when I have less than 5 items in stock\" using Zapier integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Webhook Architecture:** RESTful endpoints for Zapier polling  \n",
