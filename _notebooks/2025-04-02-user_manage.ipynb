    "### What it does\n",
    "Users can train an AI model to predict if their product will be successful. They upload data about past products (price, marketing budget, how widely it's sold, etc.) and get a score from 0â€“100 on whether a new product will succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Frontend Architecture:** Event-driven JavaScript with debounced input validation and progressive form enhancement  \n",
    "- **Data Flow:**  \n",
    "  `User Input â†’ JSON Validation â†’ API POST â†’ ML Pipeline â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training/Inference â†’ Response Rendering`  \n",
    "- **ML Model:** Scikit-learn `RandomForestRegressor` with feature importance calculation and cross-validation  \n",
    "- **API Design:**  \n",
    "  - `POST /api/train`: `{ samples: [{product_type, seasonality, price, marketing, distribution_channels, success_score}] }`  \n",
    "  - `POST /api/predict`: `{ product_type, seasonality, price, marketing, distribution_channels }`  \n",
    "  - `GET /api/history`: Returns paginated prediction history with filtering  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Smart Parts\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and temporal encoding\n",
    "- **Real-time Insights:** Post-prediction analysis on price, marketing, and seasonality for actionable business intelligence\n",
